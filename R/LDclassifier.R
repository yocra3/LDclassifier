#' LDclassifier: Group chromosomes by recombination history
#'
#' LDclassifier infers recombination history based on a mixture model that, given a pair
#' of SNP-blocks, separates chromosomes in two populations, one with high Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
#' and low recombination (linkage) and another with low LD and high recombination. The
#' method use the classification of several SNP-block pairs in a region to group chromosomes
#' in clusters with different recombination history. This package takes as input genotype phased data.
